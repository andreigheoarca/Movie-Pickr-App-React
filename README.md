## Usage

The user can click on the "Choose a movie" button in order to display a randomly pick from a list of top rated films.

When the user arrives at a film that seems promising, he can choose to add it to his watchlist by clicking the purple "Add to watchlist" button. The movie will be added in the bottom container, alongside other movies.

If the user desires to remove a film from the container he can hover with the mouse at the top of the specific movie poster of which he wishes to remove and a "X" icon will appear which when clicked will remove the item from the watchlist as well as from the local storage.
